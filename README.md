# Sudoku Solver using OpenCV and Keras

## Overview
Developed a real-time Sudoku solver application using OpenCV and Keras, integrating Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to process live camera feed, extract Sudoku grids, recognize digits with a custom-trained model, and overlay solutions directly onto the input image.

## Objective
To create an efficient AI-powered Sudoku solver that enhances user experience by automating the puzzle-solving process through advanced ML and image processing capabilities.

## Algorithm Used
Utilized a Greedy Best First Search algorithm to optimize Sudoku solving efficiency, selecting cells with the least number of possibilities for exploration.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python:** Core language for backend development and ML implementation.
- **OpenCV:** Computer Vision library for image processing tasks.
- **Keras:** Deep Learning framework for building and training the digit recognition model.

## Results and Discussion üìä
Streamlined Sudoku extraction and digit recognition processes, ensuring high precision and reliability in real-time applications. Achieved significant reduction in manual solving time through the integration of advanced ML algorithms and image processing techniques.
