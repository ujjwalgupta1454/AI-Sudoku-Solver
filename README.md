# AI Sudoku Solver Web Application

## Overview
Developed a real-time Sudoku solver using OpenCV and Keras, leveraging Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to process live camera feed, extract Sudoku grids, recognize digits with a custom-trained model, and overlay solutions directly onto the input image.

## Objective
Streamlined Sudoku extraction and digit recognition processes, ensuring high precision and reliability in real-time applications using a Greedy Best First Search algorithm, optimizing Sudoku solving efficiency. Enhanced user experience by cutting manual solving time through advanced ML and image processing capabilities.

## Algorithm Used
In general, Sudoku is solved using a Backtracking approach, which is a brute-force method. Here, we utilize a Greedy Best First Search approach, choosing a cell with the least number of possibilities to search next, thereby optimizing the solving process.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python:** Core language for backend development and ML implementation.
- **OpenCV:** Image processing library for Sudoku grid extraction and digit recognition.
- **Keras:** Deep Learning framework used to train and deploy the digit recognition model.
- **Machine Learning:** Algorithms for predictive modeling and user interaction enhancement.

## Results and Discussion üìä
The AI Sudoku Solver successfully automates the solving process with high accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications. By integrating advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, manual solving time is significantly reduced, providing a seamless user experience.
